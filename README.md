# learning-tech-with-alexa

This repo is a space to document my journey learning and applying tech skills — including Python, APIs, automation, and AI workflows.

## ✅ Project 1: Cat Fact Script

This was my first script in Python after returning to coding. I wrote a function that simulates pulling data from an API and prints a random cat fact. It helped me understand:

- How APIs return data
- How to parse JSON-like structures
- How to structure a Python function
- How to use GitHub and upload files correctly

## 🪞Reflection

I’m doing this to build real, job-ready skills without taking long, expensive courses. I want this to be ADHD-friendly and sustainable. I’m not here to “learn to code” — I’m here to **become fluent enough to get hired in tech**.
